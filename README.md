# Website Performance Audit Report

## 📌 Executive Summary

This Lighthouse desktop audit shows:

✅ Decent First Contentful Paint (~1.2 s)  
⚠️ Poor Largest Contentful Paint (3.0 s)  
⚠️ Slow Speed Index (3.1 s)

Your site is currently shipping **large images**, **bloated JavaScript bundles**, and **blocking fonts**, leading to slower loading and rendering even on desktop. Mobile will perform worse.

## ⚡️ Current Performance Metrics

| Metric                         | Value  | Verdict              |
|--------------------------------|--------|----------------------|
| First Contentful Paint (FCP)   | 1.2 s  | ✅ Good               |
| Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) | 3.0 s  | ⚠️ Needs Improvement  |
| Speed Index                    | 3.1 s  | ⚠️ Poor               |
| Viewport Meta Tag              | Present| ✅ Good               |
| Chrome Extension Warning       | Present| ⚠️ May have skewed results |

> Note: This was a **desktop audit**, so these times will be *worse on mobile*.

## 🔍 Main Identified Issues

### 1️⃣ Large Images
- Many `_next/image` assets >200–300 KB.
- Likely no AVIF/WebP enforcement.
- Overly high quality settings.
- Poor responsive sizing.

---

### 2️⃣ Bloated JavaScript
- Large vendor bundles.
- Poor code splitting.
- Client-heavy hydration.

---

### 3️⃣ Blocking Fonts
- Multiple Google Font weights.
- No `display=swap`.
- Not self-hosted.

---

### 4️⃣ Render-Blocking Resources
- Inline CSS and JS blocking first render.
- Fonts/CSS not loaded asynchronously.

---

### 5️⃣ Caching Headers (Possible)
- Static assets may lack long-term `immutable` caching.

---

### 6️⃣ No Critical CSS Inlining
- Entire CSS loaded upfront, blocking rendering.

---

### 7️⃣ Potential Hydration Jank
- Next.js hydration appears slow.

---

## ✅ Recommendations

### ⭐️ Priority 1: Image Optimization
- Force WebP/AVIF output.
- Reduce Next/Image `quality` (50–60).
- Use correct `sizes` for responsive loading.
- Review `/public` image assets.

✅ **Expected impact:** ~0.5–1.0 s LCP improvement.

---

### ⭐️ Priority 2: JavaScript Bundle Splitting
- Analyze with `next build --analyze`.
- Use dynamic imports for non-critical components.
- Remove unused libraries.
- Adopt lightweight UI libraries.

✅ **Expected impact:** ~0.5–1.0 s Speed Index improvement.

---

### ⭐️ Priority 3: Font Optimization
- Limit weights (e.g. 400 & 700).
- Add `display=swap`.
- Self-host fonts or use Next.js `next/font`.

✅ **Expected impact:** ~0.2–0.5 s LCP improvement.

---

### ⭐️ Priority 4: Static Asset Caching
- Add `Cache-Control: immutable` headers.
- Use Vercel config to set long-term caching.

✅ **Expected impact:** Faster repeat visits.

---

### ⭐️ Priority 5: Remove Unused CSS/JS
- Audit with PurgeCSS.
- Strip unused imports.
- Keep page payloads lean.

✅ **Expected impact:** ~0.1–0.2 s reduction.

---

### ⭐️ Priority 6: Critical CSS Inlining
- Inline above-the-fold CSS.
- Use Next.js CSS optimization.

✅ **Expected impact:** ~0.1 s faster rendering.

---

### ⭐️ Priority 7: Hydration Optimizations
- Use React Server Components (if on Next 13+).
- Minimize client-heavy SSR.

✅ **Expected impact:** ~0.1–0.3 s TTI improvement.

## 📈 Estimated Improved Metrics

| Metric                         | Current | Estimated After Fix |
|--------------------------------|---------|---------------------|
| First Contentful Paint (FCP)   | 1.2 s   | ~0.8 s              |
| Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) | 3.0 s   | ~1.5–1.8 s          |
| Speed Index                    | 3.1 s   | ~1.8–2.0 s          |

> These would move your site into Google's “Good” Core Web Vitals thresholds.

---

## 🛠️ Best Practice Checklist

✅ Use Next.js `<Image>` with WebP/AVIF  
✅ Lower `quality` param in images  
✅ Split JS bundles with dynamic imports  
✅ Use `next/font` for fonts  
✅ Lazy-load offscreen images/content  
✅ Set long-term cache headers  
✅ Remove unused CSS/JS  
✅ Minimize render-blocking resources

---

## ⚠️ Additional Note
Your audit included:

> "Chrome extensions negatively affected this page's load performance."

✅ For cleaner audits:
- Use Chrome Incognito with no extensions.
- Or run `lighthouse --headless` CLI.

## 📌 Recommended Next Steps

1️⃣ Fix top 3 priorities immediately (images, JS, fonts)  
2️⃣ Re-run Lighthouse in **Mobile** mode for real-world simulation  
3️⃣ Enable Vercel Analytics for Real User Metrics (RUM)  
4️⃣ Monitor Core Web Vitals over time
